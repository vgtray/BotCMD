# Contributing to BotCMD

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Small, focused PRs are easiest to review. Below are some simple guidelines to follow.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Keep commits small and focused, and write clear commit messages.
3. Run the bot locally to verify your changes.
4. Open a Pull Request describing the change and why it's needed.

Coding style

- Follow existing code style (CommonJS modules, semicolons are optional but consistent).
- Add tests where applicable.

Security

- Do NOT commit secrets (tokens, API keys) to the repository. Use `config/config.example.js` as a template.

Licensing

By contributing you agree to license your contributions under the project's MIT license.
